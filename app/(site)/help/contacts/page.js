			<h2 id="contact-page">Each contact&apos;s page</h2>
			<p>
				Click a contact on the <LinkApp href="/contacts">Contacts page</LinkApp> to open their page. At the top: their picture, name
				and address, their status, their country, their inbox and when they subscribed. Below, how many of your emails they got and
				the share they opened and clicked, then their activity, newest first: every email they got, when they opened it, the links
				they clicked, and when they signed up, confirmed or changed status. On the side are their first name, fields and tags, where
				they came from, the segments they&apos;re in and your other newsletters they&apos;re on.
			</p>
			<p>
				Change their status from the badge under their name. Edit details changes their first name, fields and tags, and the trash
				button deletes them. Click an issue to open its report, a tag to list everyone who has it, and a segment to list its contacts.
			</p>
			<p>
				Their activity keeps every change of their status, each with what made it: the unsubscribe link in your email or their mail
				app&apos;s button, a bounce or a spam complaint, the list cleanup or their answer to its last-chance email, signing up again,
				confirming, an import, or you. So someone who unsubscribed and came back shows both, in order. Before October 21, 2026, only
				the changes made by hand or through the API were kept: when one of those reveals an earlier change, that change shows dated
				before it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Their country comes from where they signed up or confirmed, or for someone who joined another way, like an import, where
				they first clicked a link in your emails. MailCheap reads it from their connection, then keeps the country only, never the
				address. Opens never give one, since inboxes load images through their own servers.
				{!isCloud() && " On a self-hosted server, countries need Vercel, which names each visitor's country."}
			</p>
			<p>
				Their picture is the one they set on Gravatar, if they did. Otherwise it shows their initial, over their company&apos;s logo
				when their address is on its domain. Google doesn&apos;t share Gmail pictures with other apps.
			</p>

			<h2 id="details">First names, tags and fields</h2>
			<p>
				Besides an email address, each contact can have a first name, tags and values for your own fields. Click Edit details on
				their page, or in their menu on the <LinkApp href="/contacts">Contacts page</LinkApp>, to change them.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>First name</strong>: what <code>{"{{first_name}}"}</code> shows in your emails.{" "}
					<Link href={getHelpHref("writing", "first-name")}>Names and fields in your emails</Link>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Tags</strong>: labels a contact has or doesn&apos;t, like vip, podcast or customer, {MAX_TAGS} per contact at most.
					Use them to sort people into groups: list everyone with a tag, or send to them through a segment. Tags are lowercase, up
					to {MAX_TAG_LENGTH} characters, without commas. Tag lists everyone the page shows with its filters, or takes a tag off
					them. Tags never show in emails.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Fields</strong>: your own questions with an answer for each contact, like a last name, a birthday or a plan, as
					text, a number or a date, {MAX_CONTACT_FIELDS} at most, shared by your newsletters. Each one&apos;s tag shows the
					reader&apos;s answer in your emails.{" "}
					<a href="#fields">Adding fields, step by step</a>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				When the answer is yes or no, use a tag: is this person a customer? When it&apos;s a value that differs from one person to the
				next, use a field: which company do they work at? Segments can pick contacts by both.
			</p>
			<p>
				When someone signs up again, their first name and fields only fill in what&apos;s missing, and new tags are added to theirs.
			</p>

			<h2 id="fields">Adding fields, step by step</h2>
			<p>
				Fields keep what you know about each reader besides their address: a last name, a birthday, a favorite color, the plan
				they&apos;re on. Every contact already has a first name and tags, so those need no field.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<strong>Make your fields.</strong> Click Fields at the top of the <LinkApp href="/contacts">Contacts page</LinkApp>.
					Before your list has contacts, and on a phone, it&apos;s Contact fields in the <strong>⋯</strong> menu there. Type a
					name, like Birthday, pick its type (text, a number or a date) and click the plus. Its key, like <code>birthday</code>, is
					what imports, segments and the API call it. An import can make fields for you too, as below.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Fill them in</strong>, whichever way suits you:
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>By hand</strong>: open a contact&apos;s page, or their menu at the end of their row, click Edit details, and
							type their first name and a value for each field. A date field opens a calendar: pick the month and year at its top,
							then the day, and the cross at its end clears it.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>From a CSV file</strong>: import it from the <LinkApp href="/contacts">Contacts page</LinkApp>. Each column
							shows where it goes: First name, one of your fields, or a new field the import makes from the column.{" "}
							<Link href={getHelpHref("importing-contacts", "check")}>Check before you import</Link>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>From your signup form</strong>: turn on First name in{" "}
							<LinkApp href="/newsletters/form">Form for your site</LinkApp>, and new readers can type theirs as they sign up. The
							form asks for nothing else.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>From your code or an AI assistant</strong>: <Link href="/docs/api#add-contact">add_contact</Link>,{" "}
							<Link href="/docs/api#update-contact">update_contact</Link> and{" "}
							<Link href="/docs/api#import-contacts">import_contacts</Link> take a first name and fields by key, like{" "}
							<code>{'"fields": { "birthday": "1990-04-12" }'}</code>, with dates as YYYY-MM-DD, and{" "}
							<Link href="/docs/api#create-contact-field">create_contact_field</Link> makes new fields.{" "}
							<Link href={getHelpHref("api-and-ai")}>API and AI assistants</Link>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Use them in your emails.</strong> In an issue, type <kbd>/</kbd> and pick a field under Contact fields, or click the
					person icon at the end of the subject, to add its tag, like <code>{"{{birthday}}"}</code>. Each reader gets their own
					value, and a fallback after a bar, like <code>{"{{plan|free}}"}</code>, shows for readers without one. Pick a contact in
					the preview to see the email with their values. <Link href={getHelpHref("writing", "first-name")}>Names and fields in your emails</Link>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Pick readers by them.</strong> <a href="#segments">Segments</a> pick contacts by their fields, like everyone on the
					Pro plan.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				A value has to fit its field: a number field takes a number, and a date field a day. Clear a value to remove it. Deleting a
				field hides its values on every contact, and adding it again brings them back.
			</p>

			<h2 id="segments">Segments</h2>
			<p>
				A segment picks some of your contacts with a few conditions, and keeps up to date as they change. The{" "}
				<LinkApp href="/contacts">Contacts page</LinkApp> shows each one as a card with its count: click it to list its contacts, and
				the export follows. New segment opens the editor, with a few starting points:
			</p>
			<ul>
				{SEGMENT_PRESETS.map((segment) => (
					<li key={segment.name}>
						<strong>{segment.name}</strong>: {describeSegment(segment).toLowerCase()}.
					</li>
				))}
			</ul>
			<p>
				Conditions can be on opens and clicks, issues missed in a row, the number of emails opened, the signup date, where they signed
				up (your website&apos;s signup form, the form on your own site, an import, by hand or the API), the email address, a tag,
				whether they have a first name, and your own fields, {MAX_SEGMENT_CONDITIONS} at most. A segment matches all of its
				conditions, or any of them. In the send step, pick one to send an issue to its contacts only.{" "}
				<Link href={getHelpHref("sending", "who")}>Who gets it</Link>
			</p>
			<p>
				Counts are of active contacts, the ones an issue goes to. Conditions on dates count back from now, so &ldquo;opened in the last
				30 days&rdquo; follows time, and a send reads its segment when it goes out. A segment that a scheduled or sending issue goes to
				can&apos;t be deleted until that issue goes elsewhere.
			</p>

			<h2 id="add">Adding someone by hand</h2>
			<p>
				On the <LinkApp href="/contacts">Contacts page</LinkApp>, click Add contact, type their email address and tick that they
				agreed to get your emails. They join at once, without a confirmation email, and get your welcome email if it&apos;s on.
				Once your list has {LIST_STARTED_AT} contacts, Add contact is in the <strong>⋯</strong> menu at the top of the page.
				{isCloud() && ` Without a plan, you can add ${TRIAL_CONTACTS.limit} contacts a day, enough to try it on yourself.`}
			</p>
			<p>
				For a whole list, import a CSV file instead: <Link href={getHelpHref("importing-contacts")}>Importing contacts</Link>.
			</p>

			<h2 id="actions">Changing a status, and deleting</h2>
			<p>
				Each contact&apos;s menu, at the end of their row, has what applies to them, and so do the badge and the buttons at the top of
				their page:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Edit details</strong> changes their first name, tags and fields.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Mark as active</strong> brings back a dormant contact: they get your next issue. On a pending contact, it skips
					the confirmation email, once you confirm they asked for your emails.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Mark as dormant</strong> stops issues to an active contact without unsubscribing them, as the list cleanup does.
					Mark them active again any time.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Unsubscribe</strong> stops every email to them.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Resubscribe</strong> brings back someone who unsubscribed. Do it only when they asked: MailCheap asks you to
					confirm it, and keeps who did it and when. Someone who unsubscribed can&apos;t be marked dormant, so they only come back
					this way or by signing up again.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Delete contact</strong> removes them with their dates and engagement, and can&apos;t be undone. For someone who
					unsubscribed, bounced or complained, MailCheap keeps a scrambled trace of the address, so adding it again never emails it.
					Anyone else can be added again like a new contact.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Bounced and complained contacts keep their status: their address can&apos;t receive email, or they marked one of your
				emails as spam. No email goes out when you change a status. The{" "}
				<Link href={getHelpHref("api-and-ai")}>API and AI assistants</Link> can change statuses too, with the same rules.
			</p>

			<h2 id="export">Exporting</h2>
			<p>
				Export, in the <strong>⋯</strong> menu at the top of the <LinkApp href="/contacts">Contacts page</LinkApp>, downloads the
				contacts that match your filters as a CSV file, with their first name, tags and a column per field. Its columns go back in
				through the import as they are, so it&apos;s also a backup.
			</p>

			<h2 id="undeliverable">Addresses no one can reach</h2>
			<p>
				When an address hard bounces or turns out to be a spam trap, MailCheap remembers it for every sender: imports and signups
				leave it out, and sends skip it, showing the contact as bounced. A bounced address is remembered for 180 days, a spam trap for
				good.
			</p>
			<p>
				MailCheap also checks in the background that your contacts&apos; domains can receive email. Contacts on one that can&apos;t show as
				bounced, marked &ldquo;No mail server&rdquo;, and come back on their own once it can.
				{(isCloud() || isSpamListEnabled()) &&
					" Contacts on a known spam domain show as bounced, marked \u201cSpam domain\u201d, unless they ever opened or clicked."}{" "}
				<Link href={getHelpHref("list-cleanup", "domains")}>
					{(isCloud() || isSpamListEnabled()) ? "Spam domains and domains without mail" : "Domains that can\u2019t receive email"}
				</Link>
