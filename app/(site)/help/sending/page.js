			<h2 id="review">The review step</h2>
			<p>Before a campaign can go out, the review step checks it:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>a subject, and content;</li>
				<li>the unsubscribe link, which MailCheap adds to every issue written in the editor;</li>
				<li>a size under 100 KB, since Gmail cuts off longer emails;</li>
				<li>
					a postal address, set in the <LinkApp href="/newsletters/sender">newsletter&apos;s settings</LinkApp>;
				</li>
				<li>a from address the newsletter is allowed to send from.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				It also warns about a subject over 70 characters, which inboxes cut off, a missing preview text and a missing test email.
				Warnings don&apos;t stop you.
				{isCloud() &&
					" Problems with your account show in red above the steps: your plan's limits, and on the send step a send bigger than what your plan has left this month."}{" "}
				A web-only issue sends no email, so it only needs a subject, content and the website on.
			</p>

					<h2 id="tips">Tips for more opens</h2>
					<p>
						Some habits tend to send email to spam: a subject in capital letters, a row of exclamation marks, phrases like
						&ldquo;100% free&rdquo; or &ldquo;act now&rdquo;, a subject starting with Re: when it isn&apos;t a reply, or a link
						shortener like bit.ly. When your issue has one, the review step shows a tip under the checklist: the words it&apos;s
						about, highlighted, what to change, and a button to edit them. Most issues get none. A web-only issue goes to no
						inbox, so it gets none either.
					</p>
					<p>
						Tips never stop a send: change what you like, or send it as it is. They come from the{" "}
						<Link href={getHelpHref("sending", "content-check")}>content check</Link>, which reads the issue as you open the review
						or send step. A send of the same content doesn&apos;t read it again, so it doesn&apos;t wait.
					</p>
				</>
			)}

			<h2 id="where">Email, web or both</h2>
			<p>
				The send step starts with where the issue goes. Email and web, the default, sends it to your contacts and puts it on your
				newsletter&apos;s <LinkApp href="/newsletters/website">website</LinkApp>. Email only sends it but keeps it off the website: it
				never shows there, in its sitemap or in search engines, and its emails have no Read online link. Web only puts it on the
				website without sending any email, so it uses none of your plan&apos;s emails, and its button says Publish now.
			</p>
			<p>
				Web only needs the website on. A web-only issue can be scheduled like any other
				{isCloud() ? ", and the content check reads it before it goes live" : ""}. Its page counts views instead of opens and clicks.
			</p>

			<h2 id="who">Who gets it</h2>
			<p>
				By default, every active contact of the newsletter gets the issue, most engaged first: those who open and click the most get
				it before the others. To send to only some of them, pick one of your segments in To, which shows how many contacts it reaches
				out of all of them. New segment makes one without leaving the step, like your most engaged contacts.{" "}
				<Link href={getHelpHref("contacts", "segments")}>Segments</Link>
			</p>
			<p>
				A draft whose segment was deleted waits until you pick another.
				{isCloud() && " A send can't go over what your plan has left this month: pick a smaller segment, or upgrade."}
			</p>
			<p>
				The same step shows the issue&apos;s web page address, which you can change, and what the{" "}
				<Link href={getHelpHref("list-cleanup")}>list cleanup</Link> will do at this send.
			</p>

			<h2 id="when">Send now or schedule</h2>
			<p>
				Send now asks you to confirm, then the issue starts going out. Schedule opens a calendar, with today marked, and times every 15
				minutes. Once you&apos;ve sent an issue before, it tells you when a time matches your last one. A scheduled issue goes out by
				itself, up to a year ahead; the checks and{isCloud() ? " your plan's limits" : " limits"} run when you schedule it and again
				when it goes out. Unschedule turns it back into a draft.
			</p>
			{isCloud() && (
				<p>
					How fast an issue goes out depends on what your account has proven it can send. During your account&apos;s first 30 days,
					bigger sends go out over a few hours. <Link href={getHelpHref("warm-up")}>Warm-up and sending pace</Link>
				</p>
			)}

			<h2 id="first-send">First sends in steps</h2>
			<p>
				The first time an issue goes to contacts who never got an email from you, usually right after an import, they don&apos;t all
				get it at once. With more than {formatNumber(FIRST_SEND.minSlice)} of them, a slice goes first: {formatPercent(FIRST_SEND.share)}{" "}
				of them, between {formatNumber(FIRST_SEND.minSlice)} and {formatNumber(FIRST_SEND.maxSlice)}. The rest follows{" "}
				{FIRST_SEND.waitMinutes / 60} hours later, once the slice&apos;s bounces and spam complaints are in. The send step says when
				an issue goes out this way, with how many of its contacts never got an email from you.
			</p>
			<p>
				If the slice gets more than {formatPercent(pause.bounceRate)} hard bounces (at least {pause.minBounces}) or{" "}
				{formatPercent(pause.complaintRate)} complaints (at least {pause.minComplaints}), the rest waits for you to resume it. Far over those rates, your account is blocked. A list with bad addresses shows itself in
				the slice, before it reaches everyone. Contacts you emailed before go out normally.
			</p>

			<h2 id="pause">Pausing a send</h2>
			<p>
				Emails can&apos;t be recalled once they go out. While an issue is still going out, Pause on its page stops the rest: what&apos;s
				sent stays sent. Resume sends the rest, after checking your account again.
			</p>
			<p>
				MailCheap pauses a send by itself when too many of its emails bounce or get marked as spam.{" "}
				<Link href={getHelpHref("deliverability", "pauses")}>Bounces, complaints and pauses</Link>
			</p>

			{isCloud() && (
				<>
					<h2 id="content-check">The content check</h2>
					<p>
						Before an issue goes out, an automated check reads its subject and content for phishing, malware, scams and explicit
						content: as you open the review or send step, and as it goes out if it changed since. It never reads your contacts.
						Almost every issue goes straight out.
					</p>
					<p>
						When an issue looks clearly harmful, its send waits and its page says In review: a person at MailCheap looks at it,
						usually within a few hours, then sends it as you wrote it or tells you why it can&apos;t go out.{" "}
						<Link href="/acceptable-use">Acceptable use policy</Link>
					</p>
					<p>
						The same happens when an issue&apos;s text speaks to the check itself, and to new content past{" "}
						{formatNumber(CLASSIFIER_CHECKS.limit)} checks an hour from one account. An issue whose content was already checked
						still goes straight out.
					</p>
					<p>
						The check also reads your own welcome and confirmation emails when you save them. If one looks clearly harmful, the{" "}
						<LinkApp href="/newsletters/welcome">Welcome email</LinkApp> or <LinkApp href="/newsletters/signups">Confirm signups</LinkApp>{" "}
						page says In review until a person at MailCheap looks at it. Meanwhile, new subscribers get the built-in confirmation
						email, or no welcome email. If it can&apos;t go out, you get an email saying why, and changing it has it checked again.
					</p>

			<h2 id="send-to-more">Sending to more</h2>
			<p>
				A send capped at a number of contacts, which the API can set, goes to the most engaged first. Send to more on the
				campaign&apos;s page then sends it to the next most engaged contacts who haven&apos;t got it yet. You pick how many, and each
				time starts a new step, so you can check the report in between.
			</p>

			<h2 id="report">The report</h2>
			<p>
				Each sent campaign&apos;s page shows how many emails were delivered, opened and clicked, and how many bounced or led to an
				unsubscribe, with results by inbox provider, like Gmail or Outlook, where you also see how many were marked as spam. It
				counts the list cleanup&apos;s last-chance emails apart. Opens are an estimate: some inboxes load every email&apos;s images
				on their own, which counts as an open, and some readers block images. Preview, at the top, shows the email as it went out,
				in a mail app or in Gmail on a phone, as a sample reader or as one of your contacts.
			</p>
			<p>
				Opened and clicked compare with the newsletter&apos;s last {COMPARED_ISSUES} issues: &ldquo;+4.2% vs avg&rdquo; when an
				issue opened at 46.2% and they averaged 42%. Their average is all their opens or clicks over all the contacts they
				reached, so a small send barely counts. The comparison shows once a send is {TIMELINE_HOURS / 24} days old, since its
				opens keep coming until then.
			</p>
			<p>
				A chart shows the opens and clicks hour by hour for the first {TIMELINE_HOURS / 24} days after sending, in your timezone:
				when most opens came, and how fast half of them did. Each contact counts once, at their first open and first click. The
				opens after those {TIMELINE_HOURS / 24} days are counted under the chart.
			</p>
			<p>
				Its links come last, below the results by inbox provider, each with its website&apos;s icon, most clicked first: how many
				contacts clicked each one, every click, and each link&apos;s share of the contacts who clicked a link. A link counts once
				whatever its tracking parameters, like utm_source, and link scanners and the unsubscribe link don&apos;t count. An issue
				sent before clicks were counted per link only has the clicks since then. The API and AI assistants get the same numbers,
				the comparison and the hours included, in the campaign&apos;s report.
			</p>
			<p>
				A web-only issue&apos;s page shows its views on the website instead, once per reader a day, and when it went live. Web-only
				issues don&apos;t count in the comparison with your last issues.
