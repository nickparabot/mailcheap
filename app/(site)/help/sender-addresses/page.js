							Each newsletter can send from an address made from its slug, like <code>hello@your-newsletter.{sharedDomain}</code>, with
							nothing to set up: the records that prove your emails come from you (DKIM, SPF and DMARC) are published for you.
							{isCloud() && " It's set up when your plan starts, in a few minutes."} Your website lives at the same name,{" "}

						</p>
						<p>
							The address follows your newsletter&apos;s slug, so changing the slug changes it. Replies go to your account&apos;s email,
							or to the reply-to address you set in the <LinkApp href="/newsletters/sender">newsletter&apos;s settings</LinkApp>. You can
							keep it as long as you like: the <LinkApp href="/domains">Domains page</LinkApp> shows it as used until you switch.
						</p>
						<p>
							While a newsletter sends from it, the <LinkApp href="/">overview</LinkApp> and the send step of a campaign show a short
							note with your next step toward your own domain: add one, finish verifying it, or send from it once it&apos;s verified.
							Close the note and it stays closed for that newsletter until the next step comes. It never stops a send.

			<h2 id="own-domain">Your own domain</h2>
			<p>
				Sending from an address at your own domain{sharedDomain ? " is optional. It" : ""} puts your domain in the From address and
				builds its own reputation with inboxes. On the <LinkApp href="/domains">Domains page</LinkApp>, under Add your domain, type
				the domain and the address&apos;s name before the @.
				{isCloud() && " Adding a domain needs a plan."}

			{isRelay ? (
				<p>
					This server sends through an SMTP relay, which signs every email and sets where bounces come back to. You can add the
					domains the relay signs for (whoever runs the server knows which), and their subdomains: they&apos;re ready at once. Their
					DKIM, return path and DMARC records are set up at the relay, so the page shows them as Set up at your relay instead of
					records to copy, and MailCheap doesn&apos;t check them.
				</p>
			) : (
				<>
				<p>The page then lists the DNS records to add where your domain is managed (your registrar or DNS provider):</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<strong>Signature (DKIM)</strong>: proves the emails come from you.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Return path</strong>: bounces come back to a subdomain of yours, so SPF passes for your domain.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>DMARC</strong>: tells inboxes what to do with emails that fail the checks. Gmail and Yahoo require one from bulk
						senders. Start with <code>p=none</code>, then move to <code>p=quarantine</code> once your reports look clean.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					Copy each host and value with its button. If your DNS provider asks for the full name instead of the host, the page shows it.
					DNS changes can take up to a few hours: click Check to look again, and each record shows when it&apos;s found. Once
					they&apos;re all found, the records fold under DNS records, so sending from the domain comes first: click it to see
					them again.

			<h2 id="switch">Switching to your domain</h2>
			<p>
				Once the domain is verified, its card on the <LinkApp href="/domains">Domains page</LinkApp> lets you send the open
				newsletter from an address at it. Your next emails go out from that address.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can also switch from the newsletter&apos;s <LinkApp href="/newsletters/sender">sender settings</LinkApp>: pick the
				domain in the From email field and save. Once a domain is verified, the Domains page shows each newsletter that still
				sends from the shared address, with an Edit sender button: like the note on the overview, it opens those settings with
				the domain already picked. Each domain&apos;s card lists the newsletters that send from it, with a link to their sender
				settings.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once a domain is verified, the Domains page also links to Google Postmaster Tools, where you can see how Gmail rates your
				domain.
			</p>

			<h2 id="remove">Removing a domain</h2>
			<p>
				Removing a domain stops newsletters on it from sending until they move to another address. It&apos;s refused while a campaign
				from it is sending, paused or scheduled. Adding the domain again later needs new DNS records.
			</p>
			<p>
				Bounces, complaints and how they affect your sending are covered in{" "}
				<Link href={getHelpHref("deliverability")}>Bounces, complaints and pauses</Link>.
